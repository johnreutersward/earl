%% @doc Initiates a game of guess the number. It takes a list of players as a parameter
%% and sends a welcome message to each player. It also randomly picks a number between 0 and 100.
%% The function returns the initial state of the game.
%% A state is a tuple of three elements. The first element is the state of the game, it can be gameInProgress or gameOver. 
%% The second element in the tuple represents the number that the players are supposed to find out.
%% The last element in  the tuple is a tuple representing the current player's pid and alias.
%% @spec init(Players) -> State

init(Players) -> 
    random:seed(erlang:now()),

    Message = "\nWelcome to Guess The Number! Guess a number between 0 and 100.\n",
    gameAPI:print(Message,Players),
	{gameInProgress, The_number, {noPid, noPlayer}}.

%% @doc This function handles the current turn. It takes as parameters the current state of the game,
%% the current player, and the list of players. The function informs which players turn it is and then prompts the current player for an input.
%% It informs the other players what the current player guessed. If the guess was correct the game state is changed to gameOver.
%% If the guess was worng, the function informs the players if the correct number is smaller or larger. 
%% Then the function returns the new state.
%% @spec nextTurn(State,Player,Players) -> NewState
